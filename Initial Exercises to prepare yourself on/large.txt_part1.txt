Dear Recruitment Committee,
I am writing to apply for the Imagery Science and Analytics Internship at your company. I have been working in the field of AI and Machine Learning for a few years now, and I think I would be a good fit for this role. I am also familiar with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Computing concepts, including Amazon Sagemaker, which is an umbrella of services AWS provides to specifically support machine learning workflows.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Imagery Science and Analytics Internship program was too much of a coincidence for me to ignore, since I am currently on the verge of finishing the AWS AI & ML Scholarship program in August 2024.
This scholarship has made me practice, but also confident enough to apply for your life-changing opportunity, where I can finally make my dreams of securing a successful career come true.
I personally need at this stage of my career to specialize in some specific knowledge domain within the data science field in order to enhance my skills and capacity to contribute to the greater impact of society.
