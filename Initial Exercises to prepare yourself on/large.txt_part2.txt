I have been in the scientific field from Mechanical Engineering to Artificial Intelligence for close to five years now.
I started with research from my design project (during my bachelor's degree program), to now engaging with hands-on projects from the start of my Nano degree program.
As an undergraduate student of the Mechanical Engineering course, I had the opportunity to also study Sensors, Transducers and Actuators, Probability and Statistics for Engineers, Fundamentals of Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Industrial Safety. This has given me the basis from designing my very first project during my bachelor’s degree to understanding how to implement safety standards and best practices where necessary to reduce the risk of accidents. After obtaining my bachelor's degree, I developed a strong interest in putting my full energy into exploring the world of AI, machine learning, and deep learning. This was what led me to participate, compete, and win the AWS AI & ML Scholarship 2023 Winter Cohort.
Since then, things have not been the same again. I have grown and gained experience in Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Amazon SageMaker, and PyTorch.
By August 2024, when I will be done with my final Nano degree “Machine Learning Fundamentals”, I am convinced that I will be a good match for what will be required in your internship program, based on the variety of Machine Learning projects I have completed to this stage.
