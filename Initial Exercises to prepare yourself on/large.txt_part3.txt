I am currently on the verge of finishing my second project, a deep learning project, about developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch. 
In this project, I started by loading our dataset, visualizing the dataset, build my neural network, train the neural network, evaluate the networkâ€™s accuracy, and finally, tuning my hyperparameters, so as to improve the accuracy of my test data. From such a deep learning project, I can further engage with Computer Vision to help ensure nuclear safety and security for your institution.
Based on my experience, I think stepping out of my comfort zone to come to this internship in Austria will not be an issue. I do not have any specific medical condition that makes me sensitive to not being able to meet up with all of the health requirements for your internship. I will not also need much time to adapt, given that I have attained a matured age to stay without family for the sake of pursuing a successful career. I stayed in all my three years in the university without family. Moreover, I do not have any allergies, such as food allergies or seasonal allergies.
I am applying for this internship because such an opportunity will allow me to acquire top-notch knowledge and to be able to secure either a long-term career opportunity with the UN or a scholarship to further my studies.
I am determined to come up with key statistics, such as the accuracy of my model and the percentage the model positively impacts on IAEA. This will help me stand out when competing with others worldwide.
